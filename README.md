# EsoCare: Predictive AI Solution for Esophageal Cancer Care in Clinical Practice

## Overview

EsoCare is a web application designed to assist doctors and healthcare professionals in predicting various aspects of esophageal cancer in patients using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) models. The application provides predictions for cancer presence, cancer stage, survival outcome, recurrence risk, and treatment response.

## Features

-   **Cancer Presence Prediction**: Determine the likelihood of esophageal cancer presence in a patient.
-   **Cancer Stage Prediction**: Predict the stage of esophageal cancer based on patient data.
-   **Survival Outcome Prediction**: Estimate the survival outcome of a patient with esophageal cancer.
-   **Recurrence Risk Prediction**: Assess the risk of cancer recurrence in patients who have undergone treatment.
-   **Treatment Response Analysis**: Analyze how a patient is likely to respond to different treatments.

## Technologies Used

-   **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express
-   **Machine Learning**: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

    ```

## Usage

1. **Register a new patient**:

    - Navigate to the registration page.
    - Fill in the patient's details and submit the form.

2. **Predict cancer presence**:

    - Go to the cancer presence prediction page.
    - Enter the required medical parameters and get the prediction.

3. **Assess cancer recurrence risk**:

    - Visit the cancer recurrence risk page.
    - Provide the necessary details to assess the risk.

4. **Predict survival outcome**:

    - Access the survival outcome prediction page.
    - Input the relevant medical data to get the prediction.

5. **Analyze treatment response**:
    - Navigate to the treatment response analysis page.
    - Enter the treatment details and analyze the response.
