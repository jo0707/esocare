This app leverages patient data and various medical parameters to provide accurate predictions, aiding healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features

-   **Patient Registration**: Register new patients with essential details such as name, age, gender, height, weight, and medical history.
-   **Cancer Presence Prediction**: Predict the presence of esophageal cancer based on patient data.
-   **Cancer Recurrence Risk**: Assess the risk of cancer recurrence in patients who have undergone treatment.
-   **Survival Outcome Prediction**: Predict the survival outcome of patients based on various medical parameters.
-   **Treatment Response Analysis**: Analyze the response of patients to different treatments.

## Technologies Used

-   **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript
-   **Backend**: Node.js, Express
-   **Machine Learning**: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
-   **Database**: MongoDB
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
